  ## Description:
  This is a PWA application that allows for a user to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an internet connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

  ## Installation:
  After cloning or unzipping the repo, cd into the "develop" directory in teh bash terminal with node.js installed. Type "npm i" to install packages from the package-json (whichincludes the necessary libraries for the app to function.) After typing and entering "node server.js" the app should be available on localhost:3000 via your web browser.

  ## Usage:
  The user can enter deposits and expenses both online and offline, and when the user returns to an online environment, the entries should automatically be added to the tracker.
